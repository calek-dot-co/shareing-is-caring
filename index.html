                <h2>About this Guide</h3>
                <p>My name is Tom. I am new to share trading. To get me started I asked some fund managers, financial advisors, a seasoned journalist and some people who are successful in business about how to do it. I also read some stuff online. I then wrote down what they said in the most simple way possible and then bought some shares. I only invested in what seem like ethical companies. <mark>Over the last 12 months I’m up 15.8% across a portfolio of 22 companies.</mark> It’s not enough to buy a house but it is enough for a couple of epic nights out so game on.</p>
                <p>Some of my friends have asked me to share what I’ve learnt about shares with them. Shareing is caring right? So I wrote this document. Boom! This isn't a get rich quick guide. It's just a summary of everything that people have shared with me. Welcome.</p>
