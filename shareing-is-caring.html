                <p><strong>A share</strong> is an indivisible unit of capital in a company, mutual fund, financial asset, or trust. That’s a bloody mouthful right? Honestly, it’s at this point that lots of people say fuck it, it’s too hard and I’m out. So let’s simplify it. Actually for the rest of this document I’ll make things simple even if that means they aren’t technically correct.</p>
                <p><em>The reason I just wrote “not technically correct” is because you can go into such excruciatingly technical detail in order to explain concepts in depth and to make sure you define everything with textbook precision using unnecessarily complex language and lengthy paragraphs to the point that basic ideas start to sound scary and confusing which results in you not feeling confident enough to start trading and the reason that can be a problem is because it means you won’t learn with how to trade with small sums of cash when you’re young and gain important money management skills not to mention that you may also rob yourself out of the opportunity to generate a lot of wealth because compound interest is what Einstein described as the most powerful force in the universe specifically saying <mark>“he who understands it earns it, he who doesn’t pays it”</mark> but I wasn’t there so who knows if that’s even true and now you can hopefully see why I don’t think that it’s a good idea to explain everything in perfectly correct and technically detail because it’s exhausting and not actually helpful especially when you don’t include full stops in paragraphs.</em></p>

                <h2>Shares Simplified</h2>
                <p><strong><mark>Think of a share as a piece of a company that you own.</mark></strong></p>
                <p><strong>The share price</strong> is the price of a single share in a company. It’s basically the highest amount someone is willing to pay for the share and the lowest amount that it can be bought for.</p>
                <p><strong>The person who owns a share</strong> in a company is called the shareholder. They can also be referred to as a stockholder.</p>
                <p><strong>A shareholder</strong> can be you (an individual person) or it can be a company or institution that owns at least one share.</p>
                <p><strong>A collection of shareholders</strong> is usually referred to as the investors. This is because they have invested their money by buying (or creating) a share, or multiple shares, in a company. For simplicity, you can think of these people as the owners of a company.</p>
                <p><strong>The shareholders select</strong> (appoints or removes) the Board of Directors (<em>BOD</em>). In simple terms, the <em>BOD</em> will make decisions on behalf of the shareholders and provide guidance to the executives.</p>
                <p><strong>If someone owns more than 51% of the shares in a company</strong> they are referred to as the majority shareholder. They basically own the voting rights to hire and fire the <em>BOD</em> which gives them significant power to influence the direction of the company.</p>
                <p><strong>The executives (e.g. CEO)</strong> are responsible for day-to-day running of the business/company. They hire and fire employees and do other stuff.</p>
                <p><strong>An executive-director</strong> is someone who is on the <em>BOD</em> and is also an executive of the company.</p>
                <p><strong>Shares can be bought</strong> in share markets.</p>
                <p><strong>Primary share markets</strong> are where shares are created and sold through a public exchange (like the Australian Stock Exchange which you’ll hear people call the <em>ASX</em>).</p>
                <p><strong>Secondary share markets</strong> are where investors buy and sell among themselves (privately).</p>
                <p><strong>Some countries have multiple primary share markets</strong> where you can buy shares. In America there are many and the most well known include the <em>NYSE</em>, <em>AMEX</em> and the <em>Nasdaq</em>.</p>

                <h2>The Money</h2>
                <p><strong>The share price</strong> of a company will fluctuate, based on the amount of money investors are willing to pay for a share.</p>
                <p><strong>There are many factors that will change what people are willing to pay for a share.</strong> This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Who is on the Board of Directors (directing the company)</li>
                  <li>Who are the executives (running the company)</li>
                  <li>Who is buying, or owns shares in, the company (investing in the company)</li>
                  <li>What the company is selling or creating (products or services)</li>
                  <li>What is the demand for the products or services (supply and demand)</li>
                  <li>Changes to legislation in the jurisdiction of operation (the law)</li>
                  <li>Market changes (e.g. COVID 19)</li>
                  <li>Accounting, marketing or business activities (e.g. profit and loss statements) which are often referred to as fundamentals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><mark>Trust underpins the market</mark></strong> and trust is built on cognition (what you think) and emotion (how you feel). It’s not all logical and there is emotion tied up in investing as well.</p>
                <p><strong>If investors across the market don’t trust</strong> that they will make money by buying a stock then they will remove their money from the market or put it in more stable investments (like gold) or stop buying more shares. When that happens across the market then you’ll may hear people say the market has dropped (or retreated). When this happens, you’ll also hear people call ‘the market’ a bear market.</p>
                <p><strong>If investors trust</strong> that they will make money by buying shares they will invest more. This means they have confidence in the market, which is often called a bull market.</p>
                <p><strong>When a company makes a profit</strong> the executives can choose to reinvest the profit in the company. They can also share the profit with the shareholders (with each share getting the same split of profit which is called a dividend).</p>
                <p><strong>But not all companies make a profit</strong> and some of them actually run at a loss (which means they  spend more than they make). This is generally because the company is run poorly, the market has changed or they creating products or services that might be worth a lot in the future - e.g. Tesla. Companies losing money are often referred to as “hemorrhaging cash”.</p>

                <h2>Recap & Analogy</h2>
                <h3>First a recap...</h3>
                <p>If you buy shares, you buy part of a company. If the company makes money then the money they make will be reinvested in the company and/or shared with investors as a dividend. In theory, the more money the business makes, the more people will want to buy shares in that business and their share price will go up. The goal is to buy a share at a low price and sell at a higher price. You will have to pay tax on any money you make.</p>
                <h3 class="extra-padding">Doesn’t make sense? Here’s an analogy...</h3>
                <p>If you bought a house for <code>$100,000</code> with 100 friends. Each of you would own 1 share worth <code>$1000</code>. If the housing market dropped and the person who wanted to buy your house the most was only willing to pay <code>$80,000</code> for the house then your individual share would be worth <code>$800</code>.</p>
                <p>The value of your house doesn’t reflect how much the roof, driveway or picket fence cost to build. It simply reflects what anyone in the market is willing to pay for it at a specific moment in time.</p>
                <p>If there was a lot of competition to buy your house and someone was willing to pay <code>$200,000</code> for it then your 1 share in the house would be worth <code>$2,000</code>, but only if you sell it.</p>
                <p>Rent, in this example, is equivalent to revenue. The revenue is used to cover the costs of the house and then the profit (left over money) can either be split between the property owners or reinvested to improve the house.<p>

            <div id="good-company" class="row section">
              <div class="col">
                <h2>Good Company</h2>
                <p>Essentially you pick a company that is going to make money. The more money they make their investors the more money you’ll gain.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>During Covid 19 people started buying more stuff online.</strong> Kogan made more sales and generated more revenue. The Kogan share price went up. Kogan shareholders made money.</li>
                  <li><strong>During Covid people stopped flying as much.</strong> Qantas made less money. The share price in Qantas went down. Shareholders in Qantas lost money.</li>
                  <li><strong>In the dip,</strong> people then bought Qantas shares and they went up again (because they were seen as undervalued).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In volatile markets you can lose and make money really quickly. <mark>Actually, anytime you are in the position to make money you are in the position to lose money.</mark> That’s the way it goes.</p>
                <p><strong>Hot tip:</strong> even if the share price fluctuates you only technically make or lose money when you sell the share.</p>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <h3 class="extra-padding">You can pick companies in different industries...</h3>
                <p>There is a Global Industry Classification Standard that allows different industries to be easily categorised by sector. These are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Consumer Discretionary</li>
                  <li>Consumer Staples</li>
                  <li>Energy</li>
                  <li>Financials</li>
                  <li>Health Care</li>
                  <li>Industrials</li>
                  <li>Information Technology</li>
                  <li>Materials</li>
                  <li>Real Estate</li>
                  <li>Communication Services</li>
                  <li>Utilities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Good advice is to invest in industries that you understand. If you understand real estate, then look into real estate. If you’re in healthcare then look into healthcare.</p>
                <p>But I’d also encourage you to think of the environment and other people in the world when picking companies to invest in. Although it only takes the click of a button to buy a share, what you are essentially doing is investing IN and ENCOURAGING a company. Yes, you can make money by investing in companies that destroy the environment but then we eventually won’t be left with a world to inhabit so what was the point?</p>

              <div class="col">
                <h2>Buying & Selling</h2>
                <p>So let’s say you actually want to buy shares, how do you do it?</p>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <h3>Option 1: Get someone to do it...</h3>
                <p>They will manage it all on your behalf and that will likely give you peace of mind. The assumption you’ll make in doing this is that they’ll do a better job in picking shares in companies than you will. They might, however, be incompitent. They might, however, not give a shit about you. They might also be scared of taking risks on your behalf because they know you’ll crucify them if they lose your money, so they play it safe. Also, you might not have the money to pay someone else to do it for you.</p>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <h3>Option 2: Do it yourself...</h3>
                <p>If you want to do it yourself, then you can set up a trading account. Easiest options for doing this on the <em>ASX</em> is through NAB (<em>nabtrade</em>) or Commonwealth (<em>Commsec</em>). Trading in different markets requires different platforms but I won’t go into that because this document is about trading on the <em>ASX</em>. People ask how much you need to start and for simplicity let’s say more than <code>$600</code> (which is <code>$500</code> for shares and <code>$100</code> for trading fees).</p>
                <details><summary><strong>How to do it yourself</strong></summary>
                  <div class="divider-small extra-padding"></div>
                  <p><strong>Step 0: </strong><br>Setup a <em>nabtrade</em> or <em>Commsec</em> account.</p>
                  <div class="divider-small"></div>
                  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong><br>Basically you’ll transfer money from your bank account to your trading account. It’s simple. It’s probably worth having a minimum of <code>$500</code> to start with.</p>
                  <div class="divider-small"></div>
                  <p><strong>Step 2: </strong><br>Decide what share you'd like to buy. If you’d like to buy shares in a company like (say <em>PAR.ASX</em>) then you click on Trade. You then type in the stock code and select ‘buy’. Let’s say PAR’s share price was <code>$3.20</code> and you wanted to buy <code>$500</code> worth then this is how you’d do it:</p>
                  <p><mark>IMAGE MISSING HERE, NO PERSONAL INFO</mark></p>
                  <p>As per the image above, I have entered <em>PAR.ASX</em> in the code search bar.</p>
                  <div class="divider-small"></div>
                  <p><strong>Step 3: </strong><br><em>PAR.ASX</em> has come up on the left hand side and I can see some basic information. The most important piece of info there is that the current price for a single share in <em>PAR.ASX</em> is <code>$3.20</code> (and down <code class="red">2.44%</code> today as of writing this).</p>
                  <div class="divider-small"></div>
                  <p><strong>Step 4: </strong><br>I then added my name and that I wanted to buy <code>$500</code> worth of shares. Say the transaction cost you <code>$15</code> and you only enter <code>$500</code> then it may not allow the transaction to go through. You may need to enter <code>$500 +15 ($515)</code>.</p>
                  <div class="divider-small"></div>
                  <p><strong>Step 5: </strong><br>Once you review and place your order, then go to your ‘holdings’ page and you will be the proud owner of some shares. If you don’t see the shares in your ‘holding’ tab then it means the order hasn’t been processed. You can then go to the ‘order’ page and see why.</p>
                  <div class="divider-small"></div>
                  <p><strong>What's next? </strong><br>It’s then your call when to sell. There are lots of different theories on how long to hold stocks for and when to sell. It is worth looking into Elliot wave theory which is a form of technical analysis that some people use to predict what is going to happen. You can also follow media and company announcements or look for higher highs and lower lows… again, Google it.</p>

                <h2>Time to Step Away</h2>
                <p>I could have spent more time working on this document but, to be honest, if you’re new to share trading then the information in here is plenty to start with. Plus you’re a smart cookie so if you really want to work it out then you will do your own research.</p>
                <p>The other reason I have to stop now is because there are other parts of my life that need attention (like my wife) and I have spent hours with my eyes glued to this screen looking at numbers and thinking of ideas. During that time I have sort of lost myself and I completely forget that a beautiful outside world exists. It’s easy to forget that when you’re focused on something.</p>

                <p>So, yes, share trading is something to do and it could make you some dosh but it could also cause you to become obsessed and lose focus on what’s really important in your life. At some point in life it’s worth looking up from your screen and getting things back into perspective.</p>

                <p>Track what shares you buy and sell in an excel spreadsheet or by using a program like Quicken. You will need to include profits and losses in your tax return.</p>

                <p><mark>Don’t forget that your actions have consequences.</mark> If you invest in companies that do terrible things in the world in order to generate money and you are willingly part of that process then how would you really feel about it? It’s easy to put up your blinkers and pretend that you are a small and insignificant person whose decisions don’t have any real world implications but your actions do count. If people were to collectively boycott certain industries and channel that money into more ethical areas then the world will change. Sounds ridiculous right? But so is getting a 250% return on a share that I bought in the middle of COVID. Ridiculous, but true.</p>
